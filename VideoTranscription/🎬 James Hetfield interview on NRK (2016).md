and okay take two actions nice to meet you nice man you thank you so I already released two of the songs on the new album mmm and got enormous feedback already um how are you satisfied with our album well I'm the harshest critic of anyone anyone can write stuff that doesn't even affect how harsh my critic or lars can be on

00:34

ourselves so we've already beat our beat ourselves up around the record we're very happy with it very very satisfied and Telly it is weird after the show last night was talking to some people around the record and I can't it's like I can't believe that people are liking this record so much already getting great feedback in

01:06

and you know just pinching myself that this is this is really happening and it's finally I mean it has been eight years since we released a record but the fact that there's new music out there and people are liking it it still blows my mind you know that we just wrote down a bunch of stuff that were in our heads

01:24

that we needed to get out and other people are liking it it's still still amazing so what kind of album have you Crichton created this time well I guess like we always try to do do the best we can first of all and write about what we're feeling what we're going through what does on our minds foot what feels

01:49

right what do what do we want to hear so we write this album with what we want to hear in mind and and that is the artist part of us and the fact that other people enjoy it is the I guess the popularity part of it which is always a bonus when other people like what you create you know I'd say what we had in mind or at least what I

02:20

had in mind and and been what it ends up as it's never the same I intend to write something oh I'm gonna do a story about this you know and then it ends up being something completely different which I love and that's the that's the kind of joy of being you know kind of spontaneous artistically so kill them all is what I was thinking

02:47

simple simple songs and the black album with some sonic layers to it and I I think I think at least in my mind we've I've hit that goal somewhat are you always trying to make a new black album that's a great question no the black album is exactly what the black album is and there is a danger of trying to create something that's been

03:24

already you know it's like you're chasing history you know you can't why do I do that you know it's already there it's already there so we're we're just we're just out to do what we think is right the next thing is that is right for us and if we're happy with it that's all that's success that's if four guys

03:51

can agree on songs and record them and put them out there when they're like 55 or 54 years old that's success right there have you had a hard time agreeing no not at all I know you didn't agree on the band name yeah I'm beat no no the band name yeah this album I would say yes I mean we never agree on everything there's you know Lars and I

04:29

are so passionate you know and I will speak for myself but Lars and I are the ones that to do put this album together the other guys contribute in their ways but Lars and I are the ones that really are just on fire with Metallica all the time so there's there's conflict there's passion there's there's friction all of

04:53

that and it's great and you know it's a blessing and a curse it just is when you have two people that are so passionate about something and you know my way is what's best for the album what's best for the best for the band you know and he says the same and you know we work it we work it out and there's got to be that I think in a

05:18

relationship you know and we embrace it it's not fun but that struggle is always is is always part a part of it part of creation do you have any specific examples what's the biggest challenge in the process design yeah an easy one at him and I argue about all the time is length of songs I want shorter songs

05:46

more compact especially live it's just I'd rather play more songs instead of you know our setlist is not gonna get longer you know the older we get so write some shorter songs so we argue about that constantly and you know he wants to let's just play the song writes itself and we can always edit it down and we never do so I'm very happy with

06:18

the hard wired the first song very happy with that yeah absolutely the first number is the three I like that all the others are sixes there's a couple of fives but I agree you can't you can't just say we have to write a short song the songs do write themselves a lot but that's one thing we don't agree on most of the time I know you

06:46

have a special relation to Norwegian metal music I brought this one excellent yes yeah fella talk I they're they're so fun to watch live especially that the singer cracks me up he's like a caveman you know thank you I don't know this is he's up there and he's it keeps doing this you know and I love that I don't know why but it's

07:23

really cool yeah he's like a barbarian to me it's awesome yeah but the guitar playing yeah love it you know one of the guys you know playing with his fingers yeah it's enjoyable do you get any inspiration from Weejun metal music I don't know specifically but when I go and watch you know a band like this live

07:46

I'm totally inspired you know just watching bands live that's where that's where I can tell if I really really like a band or not because I could love the music love the songs and it just takes it to another level when I see them live performing their hearts performing their passion and that is a band that just

08:09

puts every every ounce of energy into their songs so that is inspiring and you have not been doing this for 35 years mm-hmm what motivates you to keep you going hmm I don't know what else to do really I guess why would I not want to keep doing this we're artists you know I always and I keep saying that artists they don't

08:40

retire they just maybe two or less or but you still have to create it's it's like it's breathing to me music itself is like oxygen like I have to hear it I have to feel it I have to play it so the motivation I guess there's a perfectionist part of me that has some energy to it that you know this album is good the next one next one it's gonna be

09:12

better I just know it and it's it's been that way since the beginning it really has do you do any sacrifice this year a lot of Tours do you sacrifice anything I thought you were mean do you do any sacrifices on tour yeah well do some chickens backstage but don't tell anyone okay that's that's the secret to the

09:44

longevity of Metallica yeah there are sacrifices when we go out you know missing family you know that's the main thing for me I want to see my kids growing up and not miss any of it but you know they understand and then they're learning that you have to work if you're gonna you know have a family - so when we're not touring in the summer

10:11

or when we're touring in the summer they were able to come out or we I just pull them from school it's like man we're going to some really cool places this is a way better education than you learning some math equations you know really really yeah I mean you have the black but or do you plan any other concept

10:39

tours Wow I think around anniversaries obviously there's some need to celebrate concept tours well obviously the hardwired to self-destruct will become a tour of sorts I don't know what it's gonna look like yet what the stage thing is but there's a lot of great visuals and as far as the videos that we're doing doing

11:13

a lot of really cool videos for this there's a lot of creative stuff that's happening visually even from the music so fortunately the lyrics have a lot of of a lot of content in them too to bring into visuals but yeah really looking forward to touring and bringing some of the album cover to life some of the

11:37

crazy layered things that these photographers herring and herring they did the cover you know making something like that work live somehow when you said yeah the black album like going out and playing the black album in its entirety hmm that that happens as well don't have any plans for that quite yet this album is is our main focus and

12:01

we're super excited and proud of it do you have any precautions that you do before going on tour or on the stage mm-hmm yeah we cut the heads off of chickens and we yeah two hours before the rituals kind of start you know there's the e you know you got to get right amount of food you know for us well well for us we're

12:31

all different we're all really different and for each one of the four of us mind/body/spirit we take care of ourselves in different ways so getting stretched you know at this age is pretty important because it's very physical onstage getting the right amount of food-wise you know for me my body loves protein I just I love eating meat so

12:57

that's what I do other guys have their own things you know going in and doing some vocal stuff not so much warming up but you know we play before we go out we have a little room or we have our stuff in and it's always good before we go on to the stage to like if maybe we haven't seen each other all day and we go in and you know

13:22

I notice hey you're you look tired what's going on you know and we were able to talk and communicate and know about each other and not you know find out about it on the stage like you know oh he's tired I'm not gonna give him a hard time I'll help him instead you know
