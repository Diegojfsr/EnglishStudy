00:00

go ahead go ahead they're very excited I know thank you so much welcome back I'm so happy to be back I know it's been a minute since you've been here but I did my mom was like who did you say hi to when you were on the Emy and I was like I don't even know if you knew but I just saw you and I was like oh hey but you were in white

00:22

right you were you didn't even know but I was just like I just looked out and I just saw you and I was like well I guess I'll say hi well why you say hi you want to know what I walked in and out I literally walked on stage and walked out my dress was actually riding up the entire time so a lot of people saw

00:37

something they didn't want to see so I'm so sorry I didn't I was I was on stage I literally walked out to present an award and I'd come from another job so I literally walked in the building and walked on the stage to the and I was like oh there she and you look so you were so radiant like in that white dress

00:51

it was so beautiful thank you so much yeah you like stuck out to me thank you but you've had a big life change since then you've turned 30 right yes that's awesome was it a fun party did you plan a big yeah I never throw myself parties and I thought I should right because it's 30 and I fully enjoyed it but I think I've

01:11

been really enjoying the process of being 30 and you know learning to put up with things that I can and and just caring about who who I surround myself with it's been kind of a jty 100% pick the weeds keep the flowers that's what I say I feel like too also and I I found myself saying I watched your documentary

01:32

with my mom and my sister and we were there visiting and I was like oh I want to watch this thing I was like she's coming on watching that it reminded me of several relationships and friendships in my life and I feel like friendships have seasons and that's not a bad thing I feel like people can come in and out

01:46

of your lives at different times and I I felt like do you feel similar to that yeah they're actually I mean we started shooting this in 2016 and there are people in that dock that are no longer in my life because that was the right thing to do yeah and and not necessarily a bad thing either way I always feel

02:03

like it's one of those things where it's like we're all on different like paths and it's okay that we didn't meet up right now cuz we might meet up again later yeah or not yeah or not or not no I have those things too where it's like you don't realize that's I think was so trigger because my mom and sister were

02:17

just like wow you two are similar and I was like okay um was like loud and clear um but it was it was just one of those things I thought I think when people watch this they're going to feel like a big sister with you like and be like wait wait you want to just hold you and you want to cuddle because you're very

02:34

open about everything in the documentary about your health about the highs and lows it's not like some depressing it's a lot of things all the emotions but I thought that it was really cool that you were so open about I mean having lupus about bipolar disorder about going to speak what was that like speaking at the

02:49

hospital I went to the mlan hospital and it's one of the best hospitals for um all I mean they are they're kind of covering everything in the mental health space and so I was able to say my diagnosis out loud for the first time and it just it gave me such strength and it really it wasn't easy and I think that's why I wanted the

03:11

documentary to feel really personal but I'm I'm kind of scared like a lot of people are going to see this whole other side of me and I'm like hope they like it I think it's refreshing I think it's nice cuz it's such a filtered world like and we're different Generations so it's just like it's I feel like you're and younger like

03:30

it's just such a a different world where everybody filters everything online and and that's not life that's not real life like everybody has things right and I just thought it was very powerful like to not know what was happening with you but you knew something was wrong you sought out help and you got it and

03:45

that's that's going to help so many people that watch this I hope so yes whether it's depression or Whatever anxiety like whatever it's like it really does you watch it you go okay wait I do Vibe with that like that's similar to me so it's it's gonna I think awaken a lot of people I hope so cuz I'm really nervous was it nervous for you

04:05

cuz in the in right after you spoke at that hospital all those people like afterwards like talking to you do you ever feel the weight of that like when they're telling you their story CU I feel like a lot of people will tell us things that maybe they should put like someone that's trained that knows what to say back yeah I'm definitely not a

04:22

professional but it was really I think I'm more so connect with people that have been on a similar journey and I don't mind having those conversations with people again I anything that I do I want it to be some sort of light in the world so yeah I'm excited that people will get to see you know how how much it

04:43

paid off to be honest with my story yeah cuz it's freeing it feels freeing when you're finally like nope this is me and this is how it is and I loved how you were in Kenya like I loved how it was it was different to watch you and even having conversations with these girls and like your many Revelations like with

05:02

these girls like asking about guys that one conversation what was her name Betty Betty and she is unbelievable and um I basically went on a trip and we were there with an organization but this young woman who is younger than me just spoke so candidly about her own mental health struggles and it was really incredible to be all the way side on the

05:24

other side of the world and and see how people handle these things and how you know people don't talk about it but she was just so beautiful and her story is really great if you do get to watch it it's beautiful yeah I loved it I love that conversation at the table and everything it was just nice to see you

05:40

in that moment and I thought that was really [Music] [Applause] cool thank you guys y'all have a great night I'm going home m [Music]
