00:42

good i'm fine here's the difference between what you do uh in your employment and what we do we work for a company so we have an hr department right so we cannot really harass people we got to be careful what dirty videos we send each other for halloween so this morning we have like a filthy like halloween video like circulating

00:59

yes and everyone so far is cool that no one's ready to sue anyone or call hr but you you can just send out a video to your friends and no one cares wait elaborate what do you mean what i'm saying is what you do for a living it's kind of fantastic thank you versus what we do for look you know at the end of the day

01:17

you've got to make a living you've got to pay the bills you got to pay the accountants you know what i'm saying yeah so we do the same thing but at the same time we work for this big i heart radio company right it still is fun but at the end of the day it's working for a company right so when i send out this video that

01:32

i'm not going to show you now i want to see it [Applause] it's a halloween video i take no responsibility it's a guy wearing a mask right okay you know what's gonna happen here and then all of a sudden okay this is just for you okay and then all of a sudden it's like oh my gosh our face is okay let me ask you a question

01:54

if you okay selena if you if you shared that with everyone like on the stage crew yeah yeah yeah would there be a problem or they'd be like oh that's selena no because they've sent that stuff anywhere that was amazing i need to send that to my grandma keeps grandma happy so you know she'll laugh are you like me halloween is just do you

02:18

run away from halloween i'm obsessed i mean horror horror films scary movies all of that what's left to be dressed in costume though um probably eight years well that's a long time now yeah because i i go to the things but i'm more like i think i'm more scary i'm into the the horror yes right see danielle started celebrating

02:38

halloween uh in august yeah can i do 30 days of halloween so every day of october i wear something halloween related that's so sweet it's fun show her the pictures of you and your husband oh over the weekend she gets crazy what'd you all do we wear crazy uh what were we like killer pumpkins but look at the scarecrow pumpkins look

02:59

how great their makeup is fantastic yeah my friend our friend dina with the pink hair did it i love that by the way you have no flying appendages flying out of these videos like the other way that is disgusting i was fascinated by it i was like whoa whoa all right let's get to work a little bit of disappointment here because uh these

03:19

two songs which are both fabulous and they really tell great stories and they're very relatable especially luchadool actually both of them lose you to love me and look at her now are just fantastic both of them thank you for different reasons and for the same reasons the thing is you've been interviewed by so many other people already right it's

03:36

like the headlines are out there it's like well why do i ask now i know i know what's the clickbait fan i will say this the the beautiful thing about lose you to love me is like the instructions are in the title i mean it's just the most obvious obviously best piece of advice you could give yourself or anyone else

04:02

and i will say uh of course you know you can talk about who it's for and who it's to and whatever or not besides the point this song isn't about them it's about you it really has nothing to do with anyone else but you thank you for saying well it's it's true it isn't about a couple it's about you 100 it's you finding yourself well it's but

04:21

the the objective for me was was actually to share my side of everything i don't i only work on the things and create things that make me feel something that's the only way i'll get out something but i'm not gonna talk about it or you know do all that stuff i it's just more like i needed this and this was my version of what i went through

04:44

you know what a lot of people i think need that yeah like the same thing you have to do that in order to find yourself or or you know start to love yourself again so i think a lot of people feel what you're feeling thank you yeah and i don't think it even relates to necessarily it doesn't have to just be a boyfriend or an ex

05:01

it could be a job that's toxic for you a friendship that's not good for you anything in your life that's bringing you down i feel like it all relates yeah thank you thank you and here comes old uncle elvis to head on and sometimes it isn't always let us analyze you and yourself not here guys it isn't always about something that was

05:18

bad for you it was something it was time to move on from 100 and so amen love it now see this is the thing uh lose you to love me is getting all the clickbait it's getting a lot of attention look at her now to me is fabulous thank you this is a song in my opinion tell me if i'm wrong about someone who's out there

05:37

doing it living loving losing whatever and then all of a sudden kaboom she figured it out it's time to live her life look at her go like go it's it's a very empowering song thank you all right you can go i'm now thanks that was nice okay well so in the scheme of things we haven't heard music new music from you in four

05:59

years four years so my question is when it comes to a song like lose you to love me and look at her now are those from four year ago selena gomez or from like how old are these songs in the spectrum of your life um this was february which one was you to love me well that's recent and then the other song i want to say june

06:25

these are both very recent songs yeah so that sort of tells me that your life if i'm making assumptions is somewhere in no i think that this was the best part if i released these songs any earlier i don't think that i actually know i couldn't have been able to handle that so it's actually kind of the arc of where i started

06:49

and then to where i am now and i wanted this to be the first that i released for that reason i wanted it to be a little combination where i'm telling the story and i'm proud of it and it's some of the best stuff i've ever done and then into my other songs which the records are so fun and amazing and different and

07:12

cool and i just never thought that it would be all of this i never thought that lucy to love me would have this success i would never have imagined any of the music that i'm playing to just see if producers want to do something it's it's an amazing feeling now while you were taking a break for four years i'm sure you did some

07:33

other writing are there any songs that you wrote at that point that you were just like you know what this is not me anymore and this is never going to see the light of day yes put in the cat box cover it up yeah i have a formula i mean we did probably i want to say 26 songs total yeah and i just kind of sprinkled them

07:54

throughout the years nice yeah you know what's interesting about all the great artists that sit in this chair and talk about the songs they've written and why they wrote them we have found the songs that resonate the the most with fans new fans people who've never heard your music are the ones that they go oh my god

08:12

that's sound advice i mean that's really great something to listen to i love what they're telling me here because i'm gonna apply that to my own life right and i think both of these songs are great examples when i heard look at her now and i know i hate comparing artists songs to other artists songs i remember when firework by katy perry

08:32

came out it was like baby you're a firework go yeah i don't think this is cool i remember how like nipple hurting that was that was a great a great song that says hey believe in yourself and just go right and you and you're celebrating yourself in both of these songs that's great hey uh dr oz was here earlier and

08:51

there's a weird controversy going on between some of your fans and dr oz have you heard this story wait how why no no i want you to clear this up no no no it's a good time he was at a concert of yours and uh you started you started your performance and he put some ear plugs in because it's loud yeah well some fans thought

09:10

that oh he doesn't like senator gomez he's cutting her off oh my lanta okay so please explain to people my to goodness there's no problem there no uh no and uh please don't be mad let's preserve our hearing oh my goodness he wouldn't even be at the concert i like her i'm so so grateful for how passionate and and amazing my fans have been it's

09:38

overwhelming and i don't want to sound cliche when i say that but i have insane fans that are just my ride or dies and it just don't there's nothing that'll ever compare to that connection but they kind of go off like are there moments you have ever had to step in and be like all right guys one thousand percent do you do it of

10:00

course i do it's just because it's not that's not how i operate and that's not what i'd want you know it to be but i'm sure they love hearing from you whether they're being scolded i would never i would never i just asked kindly if you're speaking on behalf of me to not be negative there you go hey so uh froggy who's in our

10:20

florida studios he's on the camera over there you uh saw a text that just flew by i did yeah sorry but um material volume control down there uh yeah are you there yeah yeah what did you see fly by uh dawn texted in from fernandina beach right outside of jax and she said please tell selena gomez thank you for me my husband of 12 years

10:41

recently left me for his girlfriend of three years who was also my best friend oh selena's song lose you to love me has been my inspiration right now i'm loving a whole lot of me that's really beautiful what she said i hate that i'm so sorry this song has has moved her and it's how it's helped give her strength which i'm

11:02

sure when you wrote it that wasn't where you were going it was about you but it's also helping other people become more of themselves we should get this guy's instagram name and let your fans get a hold of him i will uh what's her name uh dawn dawn i'm so sorry that you went through that and i i send you nothing but love and

11:28

thank you for listening to the song and i believe that if anyone any man would do that to you it's not your person and you're gonna find someone even better there you go hey you know four years out and now you're back yes working again was was there something selena that said time to get back to work how does that

11:51

work in your life in your career luckily i have a great team because i was i think i was giving everyone a headache honestly because we would we would change release dates and i had another single that was going to be lined up and then i just felt like this would be a good start so it was actually just my call

12:09

and i really i really appreciated that support and not a lot of labels would be kind enough to say when you're ready you can do this and not really push anything so yes it was i was in the right place and i just sat down with everyone and i said i'm ready and here's what we're gonna do and i talked about all of this meaning

12:32

releasing two songs and then going into the album it's it's so cool to see it happen and i loved how you did that here comes one song and then what 24 hours later kaboom another one like whoa yeah and then the next day i was needing another one i didn't get one okay let's digest what we have i was so excited though i wanted to i was like

12:52

now release another one isn't that funny i i must assume that when you release a song like you when you release lose you to love me and you see the flood of love coming in for that song and then the next day you release look at her now flood it's almost like a dopamine high like yeah why don't we raise another one they're like compound selena

13:15

no no no no they weren't about to have that they weren't but you know if you weren't guided by companies and oh god it would all be out i would just do it you people are always in the way of fun fun suckers they're sucking your fun next time just release songs and don't listen to them it's okay oh gosh it's true i don't know but with being

13:39

back and releasing there's work yes maybe a tour um we haven't actually had the full conversation yet i it's something that i i really really really care about because it's the only real moment i can look at people and and it's just thank them and enjoy what i've done with them and feel safe because i always feel safe but i i

14:03

just i don't know because it was really hard on me right a lot of isolation and a lot of work but that's not what bothered me just i think it was more internal i just don't know if i if i had the strength to get through that before so i'm not quite sure but i know that it's very important to me so i'll figure that out you know i think it

14:24

was just a few days ago louie tomlinson was sitting in this chair and he was talking about how he cannot wait to be back on tour yeah but his life is at a place where he needs that right now he knows how grueling it is because when he was out on the road with one direction it's not easy right none of us will ever

14:40

understand what that's like yeah especially if you have a life going on at the same time you have a schedule where you have to be in a different city every night at the same time you're dealing with dealing with your own demons your own positives and i can't imagine what it's like looking at a calendar knowing i have 40 more

14:55

dates and i really just want to go to the ocean and swim sorry you can't and it's got to be grueling but to see him at that place in his life selena you he was like wow i cannot wait yeah i need to get out i love that but so it's interesting how every artist every single human being listening to the show has that different

15:17

journey they're on and what they need in their life what they don't need in their life right maybe a tortoise isn't right yet you know we don't know i definitely i understand and i find that for some reason correct me if i'm wrong anyone i feel like guys definitely have like a like a better how do i say it just like a better

15:37

experience you know i think that they get to have their friends and their band and it's so fun everyone's different i know lots of people that love tour right but i find that like guys just love it because they have their they have their buddies they have their team i'm just like emotional so i'll just cry in a corner

15:56

i'm like i miss my nana okay question okay so what if you just did three nights what are you doing four nights around the world i mean do you want to go in and meet with my team where's nana i know now nana's about to get a horrible video sent to her now don't send that to nana she would laugh she's got a great sense of humor

16:19

so what is wrong with just deciding not to go on tour and just putting out putting out an album and promoting it and that's it what's wrong with that i i don't think there's anything wrong with that but it is something that is important and i want to be able to share that with my fans i want to to do it right it's not the fact that needing

16:38

it's the grueling part it's like the travel the being isolated i get that can you take time in between like say okay i'll do a week or two straight and then i need a week off can you schedule it like that no i can but it would cost a lot of money yeah and i just i i don't like putting people through that you know as far as crew and

16:59

everyone so no i'd have to do it i would have to just go through it well so that means when we do see you doing it we know that it's you made the decision it was time right that's awesome that's good so you'll send us a little private message that way well i when i first heard uh lose you to love me i mean it hit it had

17:19

a lot of people like i'll speak on my own here it hit me in a just a fantastic way we have this thing on our show where we are we're always trying to tell people you you really can't succeed in life until you're succeeding with yourself you know what and to be in a relationship with a person i agree with that really yeah you can't succeed in life

17:36

without being successful with yourself i think it's it but see here's the word that throws people off and puts pressure on them is successful you know i could change the word out then no no no i'm just saying i don't i i always have this thing where it is it's all 100 about making sure you're in a good place

17:55

but i've noticed the pressure for younger girls and people i i know that are going through transition in their life and you know i think that i don't know what i'm talking about y'all i'm trying to like get into this whole thing i don't know what you're saying i hear you going with it of course being 100 in love with yourself is so important

18:14

and i think that being kind to yourself is also important so i just that's all i think the definition of success is what's really important and i think that success can come in all kinds of forms like being happy with yourself not necessarily being professionally successful it could have been the word happiness or whatever

18:29

but there is a caveat to this all right and that is which is one of the most overused lines of today which is the most important and it is it's okay to not be okay right yeah and uh just because you're not okay doesn't mean you don't like yourself you can actually love yourself by just recognizing that i'm not okay right now

18:48

but i'm gonna be i'm gonna work on being okay that's it that's loving yourself yeah and it's very hard i mean i i think i was my biggest i mean self-sabotaging was all i did for a long time and so i i i know that feeling of of your when you're sad it's sad and i've gone through lots of therapy i've worked with

19:08

a lot of people and it's incredible but one day my friend looked at me and it was so simple and she's just like it's not it's not a bad thing that you're crying and i was like well it's a sad subject that i'm crying about and she's like yeah but this is actually where it starts you actually should be happy that it's just

19:28

coming out and maybe view it that way and it really helped me in a weird way because i needed to do that i'm gonna ask you a question but this is this is a question for everyone listening when's the last time you cried because you were overjoyed um you don't have to answer it's just a thought i think it was a few days ago

19:50

the best feeling ever right yeah it's a real it's a release that yeah and when it's happening you have to you have to catch it and go god you really deserve this moment right now whatever it was i i don't know it was yes it was a few days ago at my house i couldn't i honestly couldn't believe that all of this was happening

20:08

good for you you need more moments we all need more moments like that anthony ramos are you familiar with him he started out in hamilton and he's been working he's been he was in uh lady gaga he's with lady gaga and star is born he and he now has just released an album and he's just really fantastic he's born and raised here in new york city he

20:28

was here last week his new album is amazing and as we were interviewing him talking about how success was kind of creeping up on him yeah he just froze right here on this microphone he couldn't speak and he started to cry and i asked him i said are you crying right now and he went yeah i said talk about it and he started talking about how he's

20:47

just really recognizing all these fantastic things that are going on in his life and it reminds all of us you you have to stop down and take stock in these things because it helps you work on the other that's so sweet anthony ramos listen to his actually i 100 oh the album i saw hamilton i wonder if he was yeah he played the double part

21:07

with the guy with the wig and then yeah yeah yeah no he's phillip and the french guy totally yeah i loved his character his album just came out and it's i've listened to it 20 times insane oh i can't wait that's awesome it tells a story from start to finish oh i love that so yeah yeah yeah yeah selena gomez is on and we're talking

21:28

about anthony yeah we're promoting well i love that he's going to pay us even selena wants you to go out and download anthony's album well anyway it's just happiness you deserve we all deserve happiness and sometimes you gotta fight to get it right but it's who was it that sat here and told us every day positivity and happiness it's

21:46

like you got to wake up and you got to put it on like makeup you got to apply it i love that that's amazing was it lizzo it might have been lizzo someone i don't know anyway look uh i love her love lose you to love me incredible i love look at her now and i can't wait to hear more from this album that will be

22:04

out when uh next year next year that's 365 days no no no no no okay good well perfect the video for lucy to love me uh filmed entirely on iphone 11 pro which i can't even i can't even take a picture of meatloaf and have it it's wild it's wild i was it was such a cool experience to try it and actually see how it works

22:31

yeah i remember we did the first take and it was everyone was kind of stressed out because how are you gonna do that we have this whole rig and then tiny phone and gotta make sure it's charged while it's doing it and and all this stuff with lighting but i remember seeing the first take and i was completely blown away of the

22:48

quality it was unbelievable and and apple was they were so they were so great they were just amazing they were there on set and they were excited that we got to be a part of that and to do both of the videos that are actually different so you can kind of see all the things that the iphone has and what it does and i've got to get me an 11.

23:09

it's wild they taped they taped an iphone on the ground and i would just walk over it or i'd sing to it and it has this incredible angle where if you put another iphone down it's not going to have the same effect where it was all wide and you can actually see just taping it on the floor like how insane is that wow that video i showed you when you first

23:30

got here i wonder if that was done i have never heard you need to it's definitely a wide anyway we don't need to explain that uh selena she's here lose you to love me uh gotta play it thank you for coming in of course it's good to see you guys it's been a long time have a beautiful day and happy halloween thank you

24:04
