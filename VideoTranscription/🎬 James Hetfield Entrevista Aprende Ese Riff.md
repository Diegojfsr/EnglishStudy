00:00

[Music] I was pretty much afraid of everything afraid of the world afraid of speaking you know really really shy kid music was a way to speak as simple as that uh I could either just Journal write poetry write just whatever was in my head and sit down strum a few chords and put that together and that's me that's me telling

00:40

the world about me when I can't do it on my own so music was the voice I didn't have there was a kid in in my high school Downey High who was in The Jazz Band who uh was selling his guitar he had a I think it was a 69 SG with the tremo and he wanted to sell it he said you want it and I said yeah how much you want he

01:03

said 200 bucks so I begged my mom and you know did chores did whatever I could and she said yeah she bought me she bought me my first real guitar uh and then of course once you got a guitar you got to join a band so started hanging out with some kids at school that loved playing music and there were it was a

01:22

cover band called Obsession a bunch of guys in in my grade and we just end up at their house after school playing uh Black Sabbath was the band that just totally lit me up so heavy so moving I I sunk right into that I could close my eyes and be in there me and a buddy growing up in school John zaner was his name we would we would try and

01:48

top each other you know every day like hey look what I learned and then oh well look what I got and like oh damn I go back and learn something else and then he go so the great you know high school competition you know got us to another level which was great and then at some point it was like wow you know the guys

02:06

I'm playing with I I need to play with better players and I was writing I wanted to I wrote some songs they didn't like them they just wanted to play covers and then I kind of decided Well I got to start playing with other people so right then I kind of knew that I was on a quest I wanted to get better and some friends didn't understand that they

02:26

just you know why don't you you know just hang out with us and I I was on a quest to go go places um I think it was my sophomore year I went back to high school the summer time to gear up to start playing football again and I had long hair at that point and the coach said you have to get a haircut and I said yeah but Eddie Van Halen's got long

02:49

hair and Michael shanker's got long hair I I want to play football and have long hair you can't do it so right then it was one of those Forks in the road that was pretty pivotal in my life that I had no clue about and I kind of just said well you know screw this do I want to be second strings you know playing football

03:09

or do I want to be up on stage you know with a mission you know speaking through music uh I didn't know it at the time but it was pretty much the right choice a [Music] I don't think it really hit me until probably after um After High School where I realized wow I got to

04:17

start thinking about what I what I want to do you know I'd be working at the sticker Factory uh you know cutting stock and just thinking of riffs or lyrics or something you know at lunchtime I'd be out in the out in the car with my guitar riding some riffs and the you know oh shoot I got to get back to work then after work you know show

04:36

the riffs that I had written and you know we did our first gig and then was then it was kind of like you know I think I want to quit my job I want to start playing music and uh it was there was no other option that's that's kind of how it was when I like the first time hey we're going to we're going to New Jersey to sign up or we're going you

04:59

know one of the first things like we're going up to San Francisco to play a show oh my God and then hey we could sign up with this manager he's talking about going to Europe and all this stuff it's like yeah whatever you know trying to act cool but inside I'm I'm freaking out flipping like this is this is happening

05:18

this is really happening and all of us are friends and we're we get to do what we want that's amazing and every step of that way has been a little more of it every day we wake up there is that reminder again that dude you get to do what you want to do and create and it's sustaining you sustaining your family it's an amazing

05:39

gift so for us to to keep keep track of that you know there was certainly a time when it got out of control you know the Black Album Black Album tour out for a long time I mean that was the album there was multiple divorces uh lots of egos you know swollen to you know uh uh uh no one was no one was right sized

06:02

anymore everyone was bigger than they should have been but if you at the end of the day when you look at this this career is is bizarre people saying they respect you for your music but then you the the the the validation that you get out there it's unreal it's it's like a fantasy it's like these people think

06:20

you're something more than you really are so you got to stay grounded it's like God I'm human you know so something comes back again and knocks you back down and to reality you know and you realize that I have a gift of playing music that's what I got [Music] h [Music] I think being on stage is a different

07:40

hat it's a different mindset it's a different space it's uh to me time stops there's no pain there's it's it's it's like you know when when people artists talk about being in the zone that is the Zone uh I can get in that zone even here just sitting playing and forget you guys are here it somehow the world goes away

08:03

whether that's good or bad it's difficult to come out of sometimes but you know that's the curse of it but the blessing is there is that focus and there is that a sense of purpose sense of being sense of communication sense of creation um there's there like that's a reason that's a reason I'm I'm here there's

08:25

times when I I haven't played for a couple weeks and my wife will say God you're grumpy go play guitar it's like oh yeah and I'll go and I'll play and then oh I feel better now it's just it's just what it is it's a it's it's a part of me it's like I got to have it you know it's it's my coffee in the morning

08:44

too and it's my my chill in the evening the music just makes us do things that we normally wouldn't do I mean I'm not going to be jumping around here you know screaming in people's faces you know by by the power of some riff coming coming out of this amp you know it's just kind of unfriendly really it's rude downright rude uh but

09:08

that's what we get to do on stage we get to express the music out of every pore out of every every part of us [Music] most things in life that uh are worthwhile you got to work at you got to work at you get out what you put in as simple as that that's a kind of a universal law so yeah it's not pick up the guitar and go haha uh which I've

09:55

done you know in front of the mirror Lots you know hey I'm really good and you got to have that attitude too but it does take work it does take uh you know some dedication you know but if you love doing it it's not as hard as as it as it could be if you're you know you're doing something that's not you're not as interested in there's nothing

10:16

more inspirational than me plugging in to an amp that's dialed to my sound and turning it up there's just nothing more inspirational I can could write 20 riffs just like that if it's if it's passing through me you know there's there's just stuff coming through I do believe that you know to keep what you got you got to

10:41

give it away and so to show up you know doing benefit type things uh helping others with the gift that we have uh you know we've got all we need we've got more than enough that we need so to give back for sure you know little kids rock is something that I'm involved D with just played a gig down south and raised

11:02

a quarter of a million dollars this is unbelievable bringing uh instruments into public schools where music programs are cut I think if there's a kid out there that's got that gift or there just needs a little something whatever it may be you know if it's that $5 guitar at the swap meet that shows up for somebody else

11:25

somewhere else and I've helped with that it's a good feeling that's a better feeling than most of the other feelings on this planet
