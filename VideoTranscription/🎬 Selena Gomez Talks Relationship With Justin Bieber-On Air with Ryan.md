and look who's here Selena Gomez hi Ryan so good to see you's already crying oh no okay so I I want to get right to this because we've been talking about you being here and it's a it's a it's a really important day um and and I think that this is a it's an important conversation to have let me play the beginning of the music video this this

00:22

dialogue that you're going to hear this conversation that you're going to hear is Selena um by herself and we'll talk a little bit about it but listen that is really powerly scarily vulnerable did you go into a room by yourself and turn on a microphone yeah they um they taped the mic underneath the table when I was shooting the video

00:44

and I had shot the video over a year ago so in that state where I was in that place emotionally I went in and I went into the room by myself and I looked at the actual mirror in the music video and I had a conversation about ti ti to myself to what to every question I had in my mind in that moment what wow this feeling changes everything

01:09

and and you can't help it and I think it just happened and and we picked a few of the the clips and and it kind of worked perfectly it was where I was in that in that so this is obviously it's about your relationship with Justin there's no secret there were you and are you nervous about letting everybody in and letting

01:31

everybody hear what exactly is going on in your mind and in your heart why everybody wants to form their own opinions anyway well that that's what I wonder did you feel like you needed to explain yourself because it's so played out in the media I think I think the biggest problem I had this year even with with him and and on his side is

01:52

identity I think people I'm literally and I was 21 this year I turned 22 I was trying to figure figure out what I'm doing and it was the first time that I was constantly being kicked down for doing that when I didn't know I just wanted to say this this is what I want I don't this is where I am in my professional life things changed in my

02:14

personal life things changed my heart everything and people just thought all right well this is what we think and yeah I made some decisions that weren't great as well and and so did he and and that's why I feel like we went through all that to only make us better and he has heard it and and he has seen the

02:35

video and it's something that I feel like girls need to hear and it's something I'm willing to share with people what did Justin say to you after he saw the video and after he heard the song for the first time um he thought it was beautiful I think it was really hard at first did he cry like I did the first

02:54

time he saw it I think he was a little jealous of the video guy at first good he should yeah no honestly music is is an expression and for me to be able to to if you will be that voice for these girls there are so many people that feel this this is by it's not only girls dudes feel this too it's a heart it's

03:18

the brain is telling you for everything that you should be doing that is reality and then this other organ takes over and makes you do things like what do we what's the answer to that what are we who we supposed to listen to our brain or our heart I think we're always going to have that choice no matter how old

03:36

you are it's like you're going to do something and you're going to say this might be right this might be wrong but I'm just going to go for it and see what happens and hope for the best so you said you shot the video a year ago okay tell me what transpired in that year did you think about releasing the song right away and

03:53

hold it back the video was supposed to come out three times and through coincidence or through changes it just didn't happen and like changes in your life or changes music in your life your real life and it's also a step for me knowing like okay this is what I'm about to say and I need to say it when I'm ready and I think after this year it's

04:17

the perfect way to end the year it's the perfect way to end a chapter in a way it's it's like this is what I'll say about every single person that has judged me for every decision I've made for every PE every person every heart that is being judged for something they've done and now I just want to release it and I want to keep going and

04:36

I want to work on things and have all the focus then just be on what I love and have fun and new music and a new chapter in my life I'm excited is the chapter over like do you feel like this is is the book closing I think in a lot of ways I'm just at peace now you know I think there's a struggle with figuring

04:56

out is it right is it wrong I don't know what the future s and that's exactly what I say in the song what do you think you've what do you think you've learned like I know that you've reflected a lot yeah and I know that you spent time getting to know who you are like what do you think you have learned when you wake

05:12

up in the morning and you say Okay a year ago I didn't think this or know this what is it how to love myself first and not just in a relationship in my everyday life I give myself so much I let people pull at me in every direction and I want everybody to be happy and eventually I would I mean I would be in my bathroom

05:35

sobbing right before I'd go on stage and then I'd just put myself on stage and and I'd want th I'd want to be there for those people I never took a moment to just go go away and be myself and figure it out I kept pushing myself and I think the biggest thing I learned is it's okay I'm going to stop when I need to stop

05:56

I'm going to feel when I need to feel and I don't care what comes with that or what people want to say it's normal I'm supposed to keep going and I just want to that's all I want to do you want to please everybody yeah of course when and we heard a few minutes ago that conversation you had which is extremely it's it's Fearless because

06:18

like that that's the right way it's like a Fearless conversation to to put out there how much more was there to what you said because we only heard a few seconds of it I spent a good five minutes really yeah yeah I uh are those deleted scenes that we'll never hear or gone for they're gone forever gone forever it was therapeutic the whole

06:40

idea of it was very therapeutic it was it was what I was seeing all I saw was black and white all I saw was one thing and I just kept going I just kept putting so because I know everyone's curious and we're going to hear the song again shortly Selena Gomez is with us the song is called the Heart Wants What It Wants

07:00

it's so simple but so smart and so true what is your relationship like now with Justin I support him I I think I always will I I get I'm upset when he's upset I'm happy when he's happy do you think you're close mhm I don't I don't want anything ever to happen to him bad it hurts meh but that's all who' have thought you'd have fallen so

07:32

deeply in love it's such a young age Selena Gomez my gosh what are you GNA do with the rest of the time I don't know I mean e Harmony's next for goodness she's got this so would you you would get married at some point yeah I'm from Texas yeah you have to right I might sneeze here in a second cover the show a ranch animals some
