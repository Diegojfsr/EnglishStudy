Hear the sound of the falling rain  
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey!)  
The shame, the ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key  
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (hey!)  
And bleed, the company lost the war today, and

Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)  
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time  
Another protester has crossed the line (hey!)  
To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another amen? (Amen!)  
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey!)  
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)  
On holiday!


Hear the sound of the falling rain.
Coming down like an Armageddon flame.
The shame, the ones who died without a name.

comming down like an armageddon flame
