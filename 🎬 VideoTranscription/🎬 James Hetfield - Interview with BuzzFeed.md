00:00

okay so new album um in your words how would you describe it like give me two words to describe hardwired to cells withdrawal beep awesome that's pretty cool and so i got in here i got a little dynamic a little game for you a game all right yeah like it's buzzfeed so we don't do like uh straightforward interviews so i have

00:31

some images here of people wearing metallica t-shirts ah so i'd like you to tell me like who do you think it is or if you know this person and okay which song from the new album would they like best oh my god are you ready i gotta think of what albums what songs are on the album what are the titles okay here's the

00:57

first one ah okay ah uh do they they have to see it right yeah okay yeah we'll just put in well she's got a damaged ink shirt on and yeah i think it's one of the i think it's one of the twins from some tv show right yeah yeah why is she smiling why do you think she's smiling well it looks like she's there's a there's a drum kit in the background

01:22

so maybe she's meeting someone that she wants to meet i don't know i don't think she it was not at our show no probably not i don't know she probably bought that shirt or had somebody buy it for her i don't know which song which song would you would you recommend her uh well ah gosh on the new album um or the old ones yeah well nothing

01:49

else matters would fit i don't know just because it's a girl i don't know um but maybe she's she's too cute for the new album i don't know halo on fire okay there you go cool next one yeah yeah all right i love that movie uh yeah and i can't remember his name i i'm terrible with names but yeah yeah um he uh yeah it was a great movie uh i

02:24

mean hardwired to self-destruct that's his hard-wired that would be his song i remember that movie specifically he was he was a hard ass yeah he was kind of a lost crazy dude yeah would you would you think like they both listen to too high uh too hard wired to self-destruct or yeah is she going to enjoy it he'll make her enjoy it yes that's good

02:48

okay so you might remember this one it's pretty much classic yeah yeah that's the singer for nickelback right okay um [Laughter] well she was related to him for a short time i think yeah avril lavigne uh she gosh you know what i think she played at mtv icon metallica yeah and which song is for her skater boy we cover recover skater boy for her no

03:25

ah well she's got the unforgiving shirt on um she might like that song i think she's a fan i've met her she's she's nice um uh on the new album uh gosh can i have a list of the song titles they're not on the back um i think halo on fire is a good one for that okay moving on this one she seems a little bit troubled

04:01

ah is that madonna yeah her name is taylor mumpson all right i've never heard of her it's goth donna goth madonna it looks like that's some crazy hair is it real i don't know that's like trujillo i think the song that trujillo wrote on this album whatever it's called that's for her i think so because of the long hair yeah the long hair

04:29

no doubt helps no doubt about it she got kill a mole shirt which is i'm impressed and she's young she looks young so maybe kelamal is in her yeah maybe maybe she was born after kiliman was released probably but she probably plays it when she's riding on her vespa that's cool yeah that seems correct okay this one ah

04:56

it's not you all right i don't know i have no idea but actually that was my first metallica t-shirt like master puppets okay it looks like a bootleg actually so this one is jay balman his name is jay balbin and he plays reggaeton like latin music and whatever and he's like put metallica shirts into fashion between

05:20

reggaeton listeners so how did you call it reggaeton it's like latin hip-hop with oh cool okay wow um thank you yeah we've we have always been into fashion you know and um it's i think it's great that he's he's helping our careers i don't know what what do you think about that like metallica and the songs he sings like

05:53

they're completely opposite like i think it's amazing it's awesome why can't he be a metallica fan i know i mean if he's wearing it just for fashion i think he could pick pick some better shirts than that um yeah uh yeah why not why why can't he wear it what's what's your take i love it i love that he's wearing it

06:16

you don't have to you don't have to you don't have to know the songs for on the new album to wear the shirt [Laughter] obviously i don't right um but gosh we don't really have a hip hoppy kind of song on this record uh what would be close to it uh uh maybe uh uh gosh darner uh man man unkind that's that's for him that's

06:51

great yeah because it might have a little hip hoppity kind of sound okay let's move along let's you remember this one uh yes yeah riding the bike down the street that is uh that's iron man right there out of his iron man uniform uh yeah he's got the uh a shorter straw or harvester shirt i don't have my glasses on

07:23

[Laughter] can i borrow your glasses yeah you can okay you won't see anything but holy [ __ ] it got farther away [Laughter] all right uh god iron man yeah what whitsung like oh no i'd say atlas rise i mean he's strong and he's yeah yeah he's rising yeah uh uh yeah he's got his coffee robert downey jr awesome cool

07:53

so let's move to he's going to the back yeah i'm going i'm going to the back this is taking way longer than you expected i'm sure okay oh so here all right that's kanye west right in drag or actually um i really don't know who it is but i know it's a kardashian yeah all right um i think um yeah i don't know what to say she's using the

08:29

first the christmas yeah yeah metal up your ass well i don't know where she got it i mean she's definitely has some connections with people who know the history of metallica i don't know if she if she was around before kill a mall and bought that shirt i'd be pretty impressed yes um yeah but it's obviously a little large for her

08:49

[Laughter] as there's more skin showing than i would let my daughter do but uh you know anyone is is we're we're not exclusive all right anyone can wear a metallica shirt uh you know there you go this is the last one all right do you have a clue of who he is uh he's got to be in one direction or some kind of direction no

09:16

five seconds of summer five seconds of directions okay five seconds of summer i don't know pop stuff at all i really don't my kids don't either anymore they've grown out of it um but you know what i i have heard them i have heard them they have a song that sounds just like a duran duran song uh in my opinion which i like duran

09:44

duran as well uh but the fact that he's wearing a that is a i mean that's load reload era that's ballsy yeah i like that i like that he's he's done that maybe it's his first album maybe it's the one he got into metallica with i like that i like the fact that uh you know it still shocks me that we're this old and it makes you feel old

10:11

and that people say yeah the first album i listened to was load or reload and it's like wow that's that's that's amazing i think it's great okay so game over thank you very much did i win what do you say guys okay yeah you doing is there something good ball on me i get slimed yeah so tell us about the new tour

10:36

um are you planning any surprises are you planning any like big shifts on the metallica show is it just gonna be like straight up heavy metal surprises well i think uh our never-ending quest to get closer and to make everyone feel like they're in the front row is is is we still haven't achieved it yet so we're still trying to design

11:03

something where everyone's in the front i don't know how that's gonna work i think we're stacking people now um i think it'll have something to do with being in the round but not as giant i think we took we took up too much space um but there's there's going to be different phases i think there'll be there'll be arenas

11:28

there'll be stadiums there'll be smaller things so there'll be different different stuff on on this tour that we'll be thinking of but we get to play a lot of different songs now and hopefully we get to play a lot of this but not too much have a nice balance and we'll see which songs work out better live and which which don't

11:52

you know talking about the new songs like this is your first album with black and recordings right so you got like i i listened to it and i and i heard um slightly new metallica like you listen to some of the old stuff and some of the like essential metallica things but it seems that you're trying to achieve more

12:14

and to create an even more vast universe what what happened during those recordings what was your mindset gosh well i think the mindset was we've got 800 we've got 800 rifts how do we make all this music and and get it out to people what do we do the same way we've written most of the records lars and i sit down

12:42

and we go through the rifts which are better we start jamming on them what feels good what makes us feel happy what what what makes what moves us uh obviously it it it didn't fit on one cd one record one whatever uh a lot of a lot of music a lot of riffs and um gosh i don't know what else to say about it i think i think it's great i love the

13:09

album i love the artwork it is it's crazy cool there's lots of ideas for live um it seems like white white is kind of taking over i don't know how or why it's going to i mean it's going to be very different for us yeah [Laughter] so it's yeah okay so the game took so long i know man sorry i liked it yeah we had a balance

13:39

thank you all right i'll see you i'll see you in a couple of hours i'm gonna be a public forum like cool all right
