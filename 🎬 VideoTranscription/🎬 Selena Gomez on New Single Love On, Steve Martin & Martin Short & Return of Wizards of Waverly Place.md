01:59

already but they seem to have really latched on to this steak tartar thing may I read the line here sure why are we conversing over the steak tartar when we could be somewhere other than here making out in the back of a car does that mean you love steak tartar or maybe you don't like it that much I actually I actually hate steak tartar

02:22

you hate steak tartar so it just SS so well it it RH TOA tartar like that sound weird yeah tuna tartar is a little bit weirder also yeah there's just the kind of fish smell when you're making out in the car do you remember I definitely give Julia Michaels credit for that one the first time you ever heard one of your

02:44

songs on the radio do you have a memory of that yeah it was a song I did called naturally and I remember it went it it went number one on the club charts and I wasn't even allowed to get into a club when it came out you were in the kids club yeah yeah it went and you heard it where uh I was in my my dad's like I think it was like Honda at the

03:07

time and we were just looking or watch or listening to Kiss FM and do you ever have a moment of excitement like that much excitement anymore in your life or did it Peak right there no no right no God no life's awesome it's been great okay yeah yeah maybe I'm just projecting a little bit we could talk about that later um

03:32

only murders in the building is is uh you just got picked up for a fourth season of the show I know and I enjoy not only your onscreen Dynamic with Steve Martin and Martin sh but also the offscreen Dynamics is entertaining as well very yeah you I you love those guys right I do I do because our Dynamic is actually very truthful in

03:55

a in a way they just they are hilarious everything I do with them is is just a fun experience you're 31 years old right what did you know about them going into this uh working relationship well of course Father of the Bride but Dirty Rotten Scoundrels I was I kind of went back and watched that and I watched it a

04:15

couple of times and then Jiminy Glick and Jiminy Glick yeah jimy Glick Martin Short character classic yeah which probably your fans don't know that they should go look it up also yeah it's a great character that Marty does so you really um and when you started working with them you didn't know like you didn't go back to SCV or oh Saturday

04:35

Night Live I watched it all oh you watched it all now and do you talk about it with them and yeah they told me the the craziest stories about just how different you know life was back then and it seemed a lot less chaotic than it is now than it is now Natalie Portman was here a few weeks ago and she told me

04:53

that she um nearly attacked Martin Short at the Golden Globes you were did you witness that I did you did basically um Marty took a picture with Natalie Portman and then he turns around and he goes that was a lovely girl and I go I was like that was Nat for he goes oh she's fantastic where did she go and he

05:13

like had he just it just their their their sweetness and their innocence it's just so pure it's so great do you do that for Steve too do you trans Steve but Steve and I are on the same page when we go to events we're kind of like 20 more minutes l left he's relieved does Steve recognize everybody do you have to tell him who anyone is I mean I

05:35

just remember one time you know I I was telling him about a song and he said what's a dual Lipa may I ask how do you answer that question what is a dualipa I said well an icon basically was is there anybody like um when you go to a show like that is there somebody that you met that you're like oh my God for me this is somebody

06:01

exciting to meet yeah this is kind of embarrassing at the Emy uh every night this is such a weird habit but every night I fall asleep to the same show and it'll either be friends or something comfy but lately it's How I Met Your Mother so I fall asleep every night just watching the show and I'm a fan Jason Seagal happened to be at the EMS and he

06:21

looked at me and I and he started waving and I was like oh like hi and I slow realized he was waving to someone behind me and I went I was like oh gosh and he felt awkward and inclined to then come over and then my boy then my boyfriend goes oh she falls asleep to you every night and I was like that's weird but I

06:50

do he's just being honest I guess they announced the Wizards of Waverly Place a reboot will you be involved in that yeah it's um it's going to be really fun and we're I was excited to bring the characters back uh it's not a reboot it's going to be a different version I guess so I'm excited for you guys will there be Wizards in it well

07:12

yeah yeah okay all right know how different it would be family wizard H uh we talked about how many Instagram followers you have I think I I added it up I think it's like three times more than watch the Super Bowl yeah that's a lot of power to have in your telephone it's a dangerous amount of power but I I feel like that's that's like not

07:37

real what what part of it is not real I don't know like that's such a big number yeah there is a really big number I don't think I don't it's hard to wrap your head around no I don't think it's I don't know I have my theories I have my theories the reason I bring it up is because um there's a brother and sister

07:54

here and the brother is a third grade special needs teacher in the Bronx and he was telling me that his students love you and they will never believe that he was here with you so I I mean I know you got you know I think one way to prove that you were here and he was here is if he was on Instagram um with you and

08:14

somewhere would that be possible yeah for sure okay brother and sister come on down here where did he sit uh just just stand up okay and I have a phone do you want to I'll take the picture actually can I just hold you for a second oh home okay that's good that's good I'm sorry Ashley don't get jealous lose you to love I'm I'm just so nervous

08:39

you lose you to love me the day I went through my first breakup and it really got me through that we're on television get in the get in that picture right there all right put that mic down it looks too weird it looks like you're hosting a a karaoke show I'm going to take a few pictures there that should be proof right thank so much

09:00

inspiration to me always my entire life youate nice to meet you too you thank you well that's a very look at that look how many people you've made happy tonight I mean it really is that's feeling that's uh that's maybe even better than hearing your song on the radio right it actually is well it's great to have you here tell Stephen
