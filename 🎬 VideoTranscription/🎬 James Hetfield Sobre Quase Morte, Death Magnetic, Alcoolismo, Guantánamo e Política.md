Some years ago you've been starring a movie and it's called "Some Kind of Monster" If there was a sequel, what would be the title? Some kind of monster would be... Some kind of recovery, I guess or... I don't know, I would say "New Kind of Monster", you know, we've... I

00:49

think we've created the... a new life after death type of feel I think that, St. Anger all of that Was a chapter that has closed and it feels like it was very cleansing And it really... It had to happen, we understand that But it was difficult, very difficult, and it felt like a near-death experience for Metallica And we have... I think we have like extra life now because of that

01:23

I feel that all the things I understood about the near-death experience When you finally realise what things you do have The gratitude you need to show for them You become extra alive, and that's... I think that's where we are right now So you're... so very alive about the record, it's... Congratulation on the great record, I think Thank you

01:53

But it's titled Death Magnetic How does this go together, this feeling of being so alive? Well, I think the concept of Death Magnetic All, you know, two years of writing songs And trying to have lyrics from the very beginning, so we can mold the songs around the phrasings or, you know, vocals being an important instrument

02:20

Going through lots of different concepts and phases in two years Your thought process, where I'm influenced by One of the things was working with Rick Rubin I started to rediscover Johnny Cash And I saw an interview with Johnny about his actual near-death experience Where he saw the light and the tunnel and everything

02:49

And the way he described it was powerful And when he came back he had this new love of life And an intensity around it And nothing else got in the way of that Things would... Things were not important, except those things And I somewhat connected with that because of Metallica almost disappearing, or disintegrating

03:26

So, death in a new light Death is not a new subject for us But the way we're writing about it now, or the way I'm perceiving it, is The positive side, maybe of death, or... Maybe death is not the end Getting close to death does things to people Death Magnetic was chosen out of, just a set of lyrics, as the title

04:03

Because it seemed to thread all these songs together And death magnetic, it... The two words together are interesting You know, a magnet has the pull Why are some people drawn towards it, why do people leave us earlier Certain people in Rock and Roll Even in our generation, have been drawn towards it You know, overdosing on drugs or whatever it may be

04:41

And then the other side of that, the pushing away The other side of the magnet pushes away And to me it was interesting that a lot of people, especially in my growing up, my religion Not a lot of talk about after someone died There was no funeral, there was no anything, It was just they were gone, no grieving

05:01

There was not a lot of talk about death, even when... You know, one of our three cats was all of a sudden not there anymore Dad, what happened? Oh, she ran away, you know Yeah, ran away into the backyard, under some dirt But not a lot of talk about it, so The fear of death, or the not wanting to talk about it

05:29

Even when you're in a, like a room where... Like my mom was passing away in front of us, there was no talk about it The big white elephant in the room, no one wants to speak about it At least in my upbringing or in America a lot So the two sides of that, it seemed pretty interesting Death of course is a constant theme in your lyrics

05:56

Do you feel an attraction by death? I don't... I think there is both I think the attraction Getting to the edge of life Feeling alive by fear of death Wanting to... Wanting to have the adrenaline hit all the time It became addicting And obviously some of the antics on the road I certainly could have died many times

06:34

And I think everyone can share that somewhat, there's a universal feeling Oh, that time when the red light was red or something, but there's always something that That was close And... I think also the just the fear, the fear of death, what is... What is gonna happen, why, the feel... I have a need to know, I need to control it

07:01

But I don't think I wanna know It's just a constant kind of battle for me Being okay with it, and then being not okay with it Back and forth I think in a way you're such a tough guy, you going hunting, driving a chopper And yeah, and... Perhaps, do you have the feeling that many years you lived up to some kind of Rock'n'Roll cliche?

07:29

Absolutely, absolutely I think no secret that The James Hetfield on stage is what I would like to be But I'm not I'm not that all the time I think it's less of a conscious effort to portray an image 'Cause I think the music really does something to the four of us when we play it We go to another level We make faces that we don't normally make

08:10

We sweat more, we move differently, it just we're on a different plane And when there's an audience out there, like at Rock am Ring, or wherever It pushes you higher, you're pushing each other to new... It's like you're in the Olympics, you go past where you just were, you know But also that I think that trying to take that image off stage

08:38

And you know, I like bikes, I like cars, I like driving fast But yeah, there's always a soft side to everyone Pretending that there isn't is a problem, and I think that's where I was Not wanting to be vulnerable ever again after being hurt so many times, you know "I'll always leave the girlfriend because I was hurt once", or you know

09:06

That kind of feel Obviously Some Kind of Monster is showing a different side to Metallica And that's, I think that is stronger You know, exposing your weaknesses It's a pretty strong move Is the alcohol some kind of escape? Absolutely Alcohol was... Ever since... I think ever since my mother died, that became more of a part of me

09:49

Alcohol at age thirteen No sorry, sixteen It became... You know, it starts off as the cliche Hey, I feel more alive, I feel looser, I feel more comfortable, I can talk to women I can, you know, get on stage and all of this It was kind of the fog I was already in somewhat of a fog And that helped it be more fun

10:24

And then the typical story of starting to need it And then it became just like this maintenance And it was a constant fog, and a lot of things I can't remember You know, blackout drinking was not good Getting in fights, all kinds of... You know, a trail of destruction, the cliche of that But then it certainly got more and more evident that it was changing me

10:58

I was bringing some of the road life home And now I had a family and children, and... Certainly wasn't a good combination But yeah, it was the enabler, it enabled me to be more of me, I thought When in fact it was showing less of the real me I got a friend, he's 28 and he's drinking since he's 20 What would you tell him, what can you tell him, how can you find a way to stop it?

11:32

What is done... Yeah, how can you manage to stop it? It's a huge effort I think Well, it really does depend on the person, and it's a... It's a personal journey I had to hit the bottom I didn't... I was pretty stubborn, I didn't learn I had tried to stop for a year And it just wasn't fun, so I went back to it

12:04

And... I had to have someone to tell me, you know, someone... Basically my wife threw me out of the house, and said "goodbye" It took that shock, you know And fear is a pretty good motivator 'Cause I certainly didn't want to stop drinking, even then But I knew that... I couldn't live without my family, that was more important

12:38

And when I found out there were other people in my situation You know, the deepest, darkest, ugliest secrets you have Are just poison and they're rotting inside you No matter what you're hiding Someone else can say they've done that too So, there is a connection with humans through experience To show that it can be done

13:16

He last told me in june that by looking at you And how you changed, and how you managed to change during the recording process of Some kind of... St. Anger He learned so much about himself Would you say... How has the balance in the band changed after this experience? Or the communication perhaps, in a better word

13:40

Well, after St. Anger, we have done... Or during St. Anger we had done so much work Personally You know, as a group With our families So much, so much work was put into that Death Magnetic is the fruits of all that hard labor I think Lars and I are better at choosing our battles We don't have to wear the armor all the time now

14:25

I think we realise that we need and love each other more than we hate each other I think also We understand each other more, through the movie And we understand more about ourselves, which is the most important part I see myself in that movie and think I don't want to be that, I don't want people to see me as that

14:52

I wouldn't want to be around that guy And I think Lars has realised some of that himself So we've all taken a good inventory of ourselves And it's been a great mirror So, I think we choose our battles And the battles we do fight We know, we're aware, that they have to be But passion rules Wherever the passion lies, that's the answer

15:22

It's great I have to make a change of topic, I think Because time is running, but... There are some of your songs still rumored to be used in Guantanamo or in... Yes, yeah and... They are played hours after hours for the victims and the prisoners and What do you think of this? You know, if I heard some Arabic music, for 24 hours straight, I think I'd go crazy too

16:00

It's just, I think it's just putting... You know, they are trying to make them as uncomfortable as possible This is torture of you I think it is intended... If I listened to Metallica 24 hours a day, would be torture, for sure You know It's just a thing Part of me is proud, because they chose Metallica You know, It's strong

16:31

It's music that is powerful It represents something that they don't like Maybe freedom, aggression I don't know, yeah, freedom of speech And then part of me is, you know, kind of bummed about it That people worry about us being attached to some political statement because of that We've got nothing to do with this and we're trying to be as apolitical as possible

17:06

'Cause I think politics and music, at least for us, don't mix It separates people, we want to bring people together And... So be it I can't say stop, I can't say do it It is just a thing, it's not good nor bad Why can't you say stop? Well, I don't want it to stop There's a part of me that thinks... That's kinda proud that, hey they've chosen Metallica as something that's going to affect them

17:44

And that's what I want our music to do, I want it to affect people But it does harm to the people How does it harm them though It's violent, if you hear any pop song, if it's Sesame Street About 10 hours and huge, very very loud, it does harm... Ow, so ok, right right, yeah It's not the, it's not what music it is

18:09

it's the torture part. Yes, of course Torture through music... Well, I've had to listen to radio for many years, I've been tortured Voluntarily Yes, yes Sometimes, whoever is driving gets to control the radio If I'm in the passenger seat, I have to listen to Phil Collins On our whole drive when my wife drives

18:40

Is Metal... Well, there's music which is political of course those focusing us and sample actors are Rage Against the Machine Is Metal... What's the relationship between politics and Metal? Is Metal the antipart, the counterpart of politics? Does it always have nothing to do with politics, or is this just Metallica?

19:01

Well, our music, I think is... We're are talking about human emotion Hopefully a universal feel of... The feelings of humans We're not trying to make a statement I think the statement we're making is Death, fear, confusion, wonder Human emotions You can attach them politically if you wish, but... It really bothers me when popular musicians or any celebrity

19:50

is soapboxing talking about their political beliefs I think, that's freedom of speech and I love that, they can do that all they want But what bothers me is that people believe that their opinion is more important because they're popular I don't believe that A

20:18

nd I'm just... I don't want to back anybody, because a week later they might say something that I don't believe in Putting our music into a person, to take it somewhere it It cheapens it to me I think our music goes beyond politics, politics bore me Politics they separate, especially in the States for me, they separate people I want it to come the other way

20:45

So... You're always going to lose some fans if you say something that you might believe politically I want to go past that and get human And I was just thinking myself it was four or five months ago I had to R.E.M. Michael Stipe Political band of course And of course music has the power to bring people together, and perhaps to...

21:13

Yes, to gain some audience for political issues, for good things about it But you just said you never would do this And probably you won't understand any people who back up for Obama right now And right now in Denver there's the Congress of Democrats Do you discuss politics in the band, or have you an opinion?

21:33

Or are you on different sides after rode? I think within the band there's lots of different opinions, we're all pretty opposite And that's fine, that's probably a main reason we don't bring up politics because it doesn't speak for all of us My theory is, in the United States, at least the two parties They need each other

21:59

And it goes like this, then it goes like this And it's the same thing over and over, once... They balance each other out But I'd rather they balance it out through positive motions, than mudslinging or negativity They try to gain popularity through negativity And I don't like that, I don't like that So yeah, within the band there's different beliefs

22:29

So, wouldn't be universal But I believe that... I have faith in man That the will to survive, and the will to do the right thing will always, will always be victorious Perhaps getting it close down to... There are so many things I just want to know, but there is only three minutes left, so... Just let's put it down

23:04

There's always in Some Kind of Monster Some kind of battle, perhaps not a battle, but the conflict is mostly between you and Lars What would you say, what's the role that Kirk's playing in the band? Well, my... When I close my eyes and envision the four of us it's, I like cars. So, we're all in a car I'm driving of course, but Lars has a steering wheel also

23:33

Or we're fighting over the wheel that's in the middle, you know And Kirk and Rob are in the back And they're having fun Lars and I are fighting over direction, where to go And they are in the back having fun Playing games, eating snacks, whatever they are doing And they are having fun And then they every once in a while ask, you know

23:57

"Where are we going?" And we tell them, after we argue about it a little while, tell them Then they say "cool, I'll be there" And that's how it is There's A and B personalities in the band, that's a good balance now And their major contribution is to follow And that's a tough one to do, or at least in my mind, it would be very tough to do

24:25

So it's, they're as needed as much as we are One emotional moment for Kirk, I think, in Some Kind of Monster When he's told that he is not allowed to play solos That poor guy, who told him, I don't remember, that's difficult I don't know if it was Lars or you, I don't know I think that whole thing, the no solos, was just part of...

24:51

It was part of a phase. A new, new, I don't know An experiment It was too bad, poor Kirk Cause I do most of the rhythms on the album And even the harmony things So Kirk's contribution was not so much, and... And you know, God bless him for sticking through that, because it would've drove me crazy Last question: What will happen on the day that never comes?

25:30

Well, the sun will shine And it all will be revealed The crew have renamed that song The day off that never comes So, I think that's pretty fitting Metallica is on And we're on tour, workaholics Yeah, we go and go and go, so they never get a day off
