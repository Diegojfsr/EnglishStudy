00:00

hello freak [ __ ] well you guys have been through such a a fascinating change in music too because I mean obviously Lars was a huge figure in the controversy surrounding MP3s you know and that was like during the Napster days that was the time where everybody realized like holy [ __ ] something just happened you know and I don't think we

00:23

realized it back then I think Lars in a lot of ways was one of the first people sounding the horn he was one of the first people going heyy all this selling record [ __ ] is going to go away like do you understand what's going on here people just taking things and putting them online and this was a totally new

00:41

thing absolutely and that poor guy still you know he's taking bullets he's taking hits for it still still really where oh everyone who's got a beef with any other thing than uh you know Napster they it just gravitates towards that all the time that poor guy yeah he he got beat up by that and we all stood behind him

01:05

obviously he was the spokesman for it he he he chose he chose to do that management said hey this is coming this is coming let's be the ones that stand up for artists and he took that he he grabbed the flag and said I'm going and there were lots of other musicians and people that were on bored as well but they weren't as vocal or taking

01:33

the hits like he did there was something about you know even you like a Dr Dre he was on board with it but for some reason in the rap world it's like well it's all about money anyway so so what you know for heavy metal there was some kind of stigma around you know you you're you're an [ __ ] if you're rich or if you've

01:55

been successful or something it's like we got to pull you down into hell with us you know don't don't be getting good now you know yeah so there was that stigma but there were other artists that would show up at shows saying hey man I'm really glad you're doing what you're doing it's like come on you know join us

02:14

oh no I can't oh no my career would be over it's like you [ __ ] you know it's so frustrating it's like dude do you believe in it yeah then stand up like yeah but no it will'll fall apart something will happen my fans blah blah blah so they they were concerned about their own careers and not the big picture of artists and obviously these

02:38

days you can see there's no copyright laws there's no nothing man you can rip this and that and whatever and do whatever you want with it there's a beauty to that and a lot of creativity comes out of it but it it gets watered down it gets you know I don't know we we acknowledge that yeah there's an inspiration somewhere for

03:00

everything but blatantly taking that and using it is is pretty frustrating to me um and we're we're we were at that point where we were we had uh such a following we had such a strength in Metallica that we survived all of that stuff um but there was a lot of bands that didn't you know uh they couldn't sustain themselves couldn't

03:26

feed their families because of what happened and I think the frustrating part was no one really understood that music is our life you know if you take that if you take our like the way we want to present our music is part of the art like in in an album meaning like one song leads to the next song leaning well

03:52

like releasing an album here's how we'd like to release it we don't want it leaked over here we don't want this happening we don't you know a present a presentation is part of the art like when you walk into an art studio the artist has been in there putting it together like okay I want you to see this first and then that and then you go

04:11

here and you get bam you know that there's a passion behind that and when someone just throws it out there and and it just it kind of loses uh loses an impact um so if I'm complaining punch me in the face but we have survived and we feel good about it and we've adapted but the record company certainly did not you

04:36

know no they took a a hard hit but also you know when you look at the record deals the deals that record companies make with artists and you see like what what a record company selling well they're only selling your work without your work without your creativity without your Creations there's nothing to sell that's all they sell but then

04:54

you look at these in insanely one-sided deals that they cut with artists especially ing artists they might be a little bit more desperate don't realize the potential especially the potential for income that they might have in the future I mean I've seen some of those I don't know there was that one that somebody said that courtly love didn't

05:11

really write it that it was Ghost written I don't know who the [ __ ] wrote it but courtly love put it out saying that she wrote it but it was a breakdown of how artists make money from the creation of an artist or the creation of an album to having it sold in record stores to where the money gets extracted

05:29

and how much is left for the actual artist it's pretty [ __ ] disturbing yeah even uh well you know a couple years ago we we got the rights to our catalog our our music from kill them all up till now we own it finally which is weird I tell my kids hey you know let's go celebrate we've got we got the master recordings We Own It finally and they

05:54

were just looking at me like what the hell are you talking about you wrote it why isn't it yours right okay well I had a little talk about how it was back then you know you would somewhat sell a little bit of your soul to get a bigger something you know it was basically the record company was a bank and a marketing tool to get you where you

06:15

wanted to be so uh you know it was a necessary thing at that time but it's great to have our stuff back and be able to you know we own our own record press how cool is that whoa in Germany uh one of our management people found uh a place that had some machines that were for sale and we we bought one and so we

06:38

press our own vinyl man wow and we could kind of do whatever we want what color vinyl today you know or what crazy things you can do you know uh uh you guys can kind of do whatever the [ __ ] you want now right you don't need a record company you could do anything well it depends uh we have a record company we own our own in America

07:00

or North America the rest of the world's a little tougher you know there's a lot of countries out there especially in Europe and there's no way we can deal with the distribution in each different country so we've cut really good deals with with other record companies that have a vision and have a love for Metallica and understand that this is

07:23

powerful stuff and people love it and we want to be part of the family um but having your own record press is a pretty darn cool thing it was really inspired by Jack White uh who uh you know of White Stripes Fame you know rack on tears he's done a lot of stuff but he he loves that stuff he's pressing his own

07:45

stuff he's coming up with different ways of doing vinyls and colors and hidden tracks and cool stuff like that and it's it's just another way to get creative in in your career is vinyl what's selling more than anything now when it comes to actual physical hard copies of things I don't know the numbers and they probably vary all over

08:08

the place but vinyl has never gone away and it's it's I don't know if it's coming back but it's more popular than it was I think there's just something tactile about it there's something great that people are finally understanding that you can look at artwork you can feel it and then the the the ritualization of opening up the

08:33

player taking it out and blowing on it cleaning it putting it down setting the needle down and it's that's something really cool I just I came down to La a few months ago and hung out with some high school buddies it's like hey what do you want to do I just listen to some songs and he takes out the Kansas you

08:52

know album puts it on and carry on our way with exactly I was like dude this sounds so great wowow yeah and we were actually listening to music sitting down listening to it my kids got into vinyl they got a you know like an urban outfit or you buy the little the setup now and that's where they that's where you can get

09:17

vinyl it's it's there there are some record stores out there but that's where they gravitate towards got him this little player and uh they just picked out some album covers they didn't even know who they were it's like this C this cover looks cool this speaks to me I'm buying this I remember doing that kind

09:35

of thing finding a cool cover yep that's how I discovered tons of bands so they go into their room and you know I leave them alone for a while and I come back they haven't come out it's like what's going on I look in there there you know the record players on the floor covers and stuff strewn out all over the place

09:51

and they're laying on the floor listening to it's like that is what that was me you know uh and my my daughter out she said Dad you'll never guess what like what there's songs on the other side like oh my God yeah it's not a CD you know it's like she discovered some huge thing you know wow well that was one of the things that was not what is

10:16

this vinyl sales outperformed digital downloads for the first time wow shows a significant shift in how people are consuming music that's really interesting man I tell you that's just cool uh uh in general uh the more ways you can get music to people uh the better well I think the other thing that you were saying That's is like it's a whole

10:37

presentation the album cover you open it up the inside the artwork all that represents your vision of what you guys are trying to put out and that was one of the things that kind of went away with digital like all of a sudden there were no album covers or the CD was that big so you couldn't really there wasn't

10:53

you know it's like a tiny little piece of art and if you're downloading it you're not even getting that you're just you're just getting the music itself that's it well and you would you would get you know downloadable artwork but you're not really looking at the artwork while you're listening to it on your mobile device you know so you know the

11:11

event of sitting down and and and disappearing into the music you know being a real music listener not I mean while you're driving I get it it's it's keeping you from killing people on the road but when you go home and you sit and you just get lost in stuff even um like those the cheap fraking headphones man the little earbuds my kids were

11:34

listening to stuff on that it's like you guys haven't experienced music like good sound here try these headphones on they're like whoa I hear stuff I didn't hear before and uh but just seeing my kids get excited about going to a live concert you know they go there and they absorb it in like every sense you're not

11:58

just he having your ears hear something and and that will never be I don't know maybe the freaking goggles or some kind of uh audiovisual stuff will reproduce live shows but there's something about being next to a sweaty [ __ ] at a gig and you know them pushing you or uh you know seeing someone headbang wildly or getting

12:24

thrown over the top of you and there's just so much smells things like that that just can't be recreated so live music my daughter just like I can't believe that guy just pressed a button on his computer and he's singing over his own music that's not performing you know she discovered that on her own hey these guys are actually playing

12:47

their instruments and they [ __ ] up they [ __ ] up a song it was so cool you know I saw something that I wouldn't have you know really cool like that yeah the lipsyncing thing man that when you go to see a concert and you find out that people are lipsing that's so disturbing it's just what what have you done what this is what is the point of

13:08

this it is disappointing what is live performance live performance is supposed to be you're experiencing this thing actually happening you're watching this person Express themselves they're they're not they're not pretending you're not supposed to be pretending right are you pretending you're you you should be able to get his [ __ ] money

13:26

back cuz you're not that's not that's not that's pretending that's not singing I've gone to see plenty of shows with my kids and you can tell it's like all right it the mic's way over here and they're still singing and it's like well they have to have the backing tracks cuz they're they're they're dancing and

13:44

they're out of breath it's like we [ __ ] stop dancing and do the song I mean are you a dancer or are you a musician or singer [ __ ] cardio you know start running hills it can be done there you go come to Veil and and run up the 14er exactly it it it can be done but I've seen shows where there's that going on and then it'll get real you

14:06

know like sit down on a couch plug it in acoustic and and sing at a key and like really try and struggle with the song or sing it you know it's like that's natural that feels good who would not gravitate towards that yeah than listening to the album I can listen to the album at home yeah that's why it's cool to just see an acoustic set

14:26

sometimes from people you know just like it's as minimal as possible you're breaking it down to the Bare Bones just a guitar and two people singing or something you know yeah that is pretty intimidating I tell you when we do like that Neil Young benefit where it's you know acoustic only and if you're you're

14:42

freaking n naked up there dude you know every note is like you know and every [ __ ] up on the vocal it's it's great I mean it's like when uh you know you go or you're going to be on a TV thing and they put makeup on you it's like why you doing that you know exactly uh so when people see me in person they think damn

15:05

you're one ugly [ __ ] man it's like no I want to be as ugly as possible to everyone so when they see me they go hey it's you you know exactly exactly yeah you're not airbrushed yeah you see a Photoshop of yourself and it's like you know they smooth out all your lines and you're like what the [ __ ] are you doing what

15:25

you done me sometimes sometimes you got to do it or like you know if you're in ban like I am and the three guys get the stuff put on and then I show up like dude oh my God I you're a shiny exactly it's like people are GNA go [ __ ] this ban that dude's sweating yeah right right when it comes to the Napster thing and what what

15:47

happened with Lars I feel like there's two different things there's something there's what's really happening and this how people look at it and what's really happening was like all of a sudden this door got opened up or this pen door's box got open right and you guys were looking at it going well this is uh

16:03

we're going to lose our our record sales like do do you understand that like people have been consuming music in a certain way you've been paying for music and that paying for music has supported all these people that are a part of this industry that makes albums there's this gigantic thing behind it this is all

16:19

going to go away because you just put a hole in the bottom of it and all the money is going to get dropped out M but then the way it looks is look at this Rich [ __ ] [ __ ] you know he doesn't doesn't appreciate his fans hey man I can't afford your album right now is it okay if I just download it for free and a lot of people thought well

16:38

hey people who can afford it will still be downloading it and then they'll buy it when they can but that wasn't really the case was it no I don't know I you know I'm all for convenience in the technology moving forward getting music out to people is the important part but just make sure the artist gets what they

17:02

deserve from it because without that it's going to become a hobby no one wants you know I don't want to see the paramedic show up at my house and it's like a hobby for him hey you know I'm not really getting paid for what I think I should get paid for my creation but I guess I'll save your life you know maybe

17:24

uh people didn't relate that to their their career or something uh equivalent you know well I think because the money wasn't equivalent they looked at you guys like you guys are already so rich what do you give a [ __ ] there's no way you're going to be broke you guys made millions and millions and millions of dollars you

17:40

Tour all over the world and it became the touring thing was way artists made money then right touring and merchandise and that's now how record companies are Str structuring their deals you know hey we get a piece of your merch and and touring see that's bizarre though the record compan is getting a piece of your

17:58

touring to me is very strange and I've seen not just a piece but an exorbitant amount MH and that disturbs me well that's the only way they can survive now they shouldn't be around then cuz then you become a parasite because you don't deserve it right I mean especially now where bands can literally become gigantic because of YouTube I mean

18:16

didn't Justin Bieber become huge just entirely because of YouTube Jamie knows look at him he's a [ __ ] Justin Bieber fan he hides it hey me too first I heard him saying I thought it was a girl I didn't even know it was a I didn't know well I tell you the the whole uh you know would you would you go up to the artist and take that out of his

18:38

pocket you know would you go into a record store and just lift that steal it run out the door with it you know would you do that with you know okay there's you know there's there's big corporations that are rich and would you go walk in and just steal their stuff I mean there's software companies that are massive would you go in there

18:58

and just rip their stuff I don't get that mentality I don't call me old school but you you you need to earn what you get and if it gets stolen from you it doesn't make any sense it's it's hard to Fathom and what it seems like to me and I I could be talking out my ass but the record companies dro the ball and

19:21

the new record companies became iTunes they control it all here's how much we're charging for your music and here's how much you're going to get everyone's even it's like some communist approach you know and I I don't understand I don't understand that if we're an artist and we make a lot of money that's up to

19:39

us if we give all our money away to charity or we throw it back into a movie that bombs which happen um that's our choice we're the [ __ ] artist we get to do what we want it's our party you're invited and we can destroy this thing if we want I don't want you to destroy it yeah the iTunes distribution model is a

20:00

very bizarre one it's very strange how they've sort of they don't know what they're doing no one knows what they're doing and you know there was a system that worked and I'm up for bucking the system and making it better but it didn't it didn't get better it's like the like you said the cat got out of the bag and you can't put it back in man you

20:17

just can't um so what do you do oh you got Spotify or you got something else where streaming is going to help get the artist their money and it's it's um you know companies like that are losing money a lot and Spotify I don't I don't I don't know the exact workings and I'm not going to speak for them at all but it's hasn't

20:40

been figured out yet is what I'm saying it hasn't been figured out how to make a music model work and there's no one way maybe there will never be one way again and that's fine but it's still unbalanced [Applause] yeah
